# Fallout76 Perk Tracker
Simple HTML perk rank tracker for Fallout 76

Created because I could never remember which rank I had when I was leveling up, so ended up wasting some perk card choices.

Simply visit the [github.io](https://nwesterhausen.github.io/fallout-perk-tracker/) hosted page to use it!
